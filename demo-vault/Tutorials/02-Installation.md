Note: Wielder is not yet available in the official community repository, so the only way to install it is via the **BRAT** (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tester) plugin.


#### Official Repository

Installation is simple, just open up the obsidian settings, enable community plugins and search for "Wielder", hit install and you're ready to go!

#### **BRAT** (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tester)

- Install BRAT - https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat
- Run the command "BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing" and enter `victorb/obsidian-wielder` as the repository
- Wait for a few seconds for BRAT to install it
- After BRAT confirmed the installation, go to the "Community Plugins" tab and activate "Wielder"

Now you're all setup!
